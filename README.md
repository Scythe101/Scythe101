# hi :D
i code things sometimes. my coding schedule is the most inconsistent thing to exist

## what i'm working on
- currently working on a project in svelte(kit) that i plan to finish sometime before mid august
- learning java
- ricing arch (btw)

## projects i'm proud of
- [study](https://github.com/Scythe101/study) - cool little website i built using vitepress that makes it easy to share my notion notes
- [pi](https://github.com/Scythe101/piWebsite) - website i made for pi day to share the history of it
- [toogle](https://github.com/Scythe101/toogle) - i got annoyed with unrelated search results so i made this using the google customizable engine to only show results from tech websites i trust
- [Matrices Calculator](https://github.com/Scythe101/MatricesCalculator) - i built a little calculator in LOVE2D to help with simple matrix operations. the gui is scuffed but coding the math stuff was cool

## what i use
- arch
- hyprland
- neovim (for configs and smaller projects)
- zeditor (larger projects)
- visual studio code (for github codespaces)
